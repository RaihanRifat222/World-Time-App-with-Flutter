# World-Time-App-with-Flutter
This is a Flutter App project of a World Time app. This is a Flutter App project of a World Time app. I can choose some locations from different countries and see their current time. I used worldtimeapi.org to get the current time of the locations in a json response. I learned JSON response, creating multiple pages, managing routes, giving background images,ListTile, SpinKit animation etc.
